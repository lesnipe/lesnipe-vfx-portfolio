# Personal Portfolio - Le Snipe' VFX

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my work in the field of Visual Effects (VFX) and Video Editing. You can explore various projects, learn about my skills and experience, and get in touch with me for collaboration opportunities.

## Introduction

I am passionate about Visual Effects and Video Editing, and this portfolio is a collection of my best work. Each project is a testament to my dedication to creating compelling and immersive visual experiences.

## Development - Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: This is my second time using **ReactJS** as the main frontend framework in a project.
- **Styling**: First time using **styled-components** for styling and it was awsome.
- **Database**: Firebase was used to easily add new projects to my portfolio in the future, via Firebase's console environment.
- **Services**: EmailJS was used to send form messages to my personal email for a potential new client. The client receives a verification email back, once the message is sent. A reCAPTCHA service was also installed, to prevent bots from sending unnecessary messages. 

## Skills

- **Visual Effects**: Each project has its own unique visual effects. This process was mainly done on Adobe After Effects.
- **Video Editing**: The assembly of the clips used in each project, was done in Adobe Premiere Pro.
- **Coloring**: All the necessary adjustments for each project's coloring were done in Davinci Resolve.
